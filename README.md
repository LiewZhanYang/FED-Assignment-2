# CodeCrafter Gaming

Welcome to our cool gaming website! We made this place to give students a break from studying, and we've got some awesome games for you to play. Our games are not just fun, but they also help you learn and think.

You can test your programming skills with our Python quiz, have fun and improve your memory with our card matching game, and go on a cool adventure in our Minesweeper game.

We've made sure our website looks great and is easy to use. It works well on your phone or computer, thanks to Bootstrap. Plus, we've added some cool animations to make your gaming experience even better. We also use special tools to keep our games exciting and up-to-date.

Our goal is to offer games that are positive and not violent. We want this place to be a safe and fun spot for students and gamers of all ages. Come join us on this exciting journey as we keep adding more cool games and create a fun space for you to take a break from your daily routine.

##  Design Process

We decided to create a place where students like us can take a break from studying and have some fun without getting stressed. We noticed that some games can make people angry, so we wanted to make games that are relaxing and not too competitive. Here's how we did it:

### User Stories:
As a student: I want a place to unwind and have fun with stress-free games so that I can take a break from studying.

As a parent: I want my child to play games that are safe and not overly competitive, ensuring they can enjoy themselves without getting upset.

As a user: I want access to various calming and enjoyable games, so I can have a good time without the pressure of winning or losing.

### Design Considerations:
Stress Relief: Our primary goal was to provide students with a means to relax and have fun with games that promote a sense of well-being.

Non-Competitive: We ensured our games aren't overly competitive to prevent frustration and stress.

Engagement: We focused on creating games that students would find enjoyable and would choose to play when they needed a break.

## Features
Welcome to our gaming website! We have three awesome games for you to enjoy:

### Python Basic Quiz:
Test your Python knowledge with our quiz! There are 10 questions, and they come from an API we made with RestDB. Compete to be the best on our leaderboard, called the "Hall of Fame."

### Memory Game:
Exercise your brain with our memory game! It's relaxing and helps you strengthen your memory.

### Minesweeper:
Get ready for excitement with our Minesweeper game! Race against time to find the mines and finish the grid. You can adjust the difficulty to challenge yourself.
