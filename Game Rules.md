# MinesSweeper
Minesweeper is a classic computer game that involves uncovering hidden mines on a grid while avoiding them. The goal is to reveal all the safe cells without detonating any mines.

## Game Explaination
1. Grid: Minesweeper is played on a grid of squares, which can vary in size. Each square can be in one of three states:

* Covered: The square has not been clicked yet.

* Uncovered: The square has been clicked, revealing what's underneath.

* Flagged: You can mark a square as potentially containing a mine by right-clicking it.

2. Mines: Some squares on the grid contain hidden mines. Your objective is to identify all these mines without triggering any of them.

3. Numbers: The uncovered squares will contain numbers, which indicate how many mines are adjacent to that square (in the eight squares surrounding it). For example, if a square has the number "3," it means there are three mines nearby.

4. Safe Start: The game typically begins with your first click. This initial click is always safe and will reveal an empty area of the grid. If this click reveals a '0', all adjacent '0' squares will also be automatically uncovered.

5. Uncover Safely: To continue, click on covered squares to reveal what's underneath. Use the numbers to help you deduce the locations of mines. For example, if a '3' is surrounded by three covered squares, you can be sure those squares contain mines.

6. Flagging Mines: If you suspect a square contains a mine, right-click it to place a flag. This helps you keep track of potential mine locations.

7. Winning: You win the game when all non-mine squares are uncovered, and you lose if you uncover a mine. The game can be won through a combination of logical deduction and careful flagging.

8. Custom Difficulty: Many Minesweeper games allow you to choose the grid size and the number of mines, making the game easier or more challenging depending on your preferences.
